2021. This marks our highest annual net \\nprofit in the last 9 years. Earnings per share in 2022 was \\nSAR 2.15, a 54.6% increase compared to SAR 1.39 in 2021.\\nThis dramatic improvement reflected in higher earnings \\nacross all revenue streams, along with record-breaking \\ngrowth in EBITDA, a remarkable growth in net profit, and \\nefficient management of operations. It was also a result of \\ndisciplined cost management, despite a 20.2% year-on-\\nyear increase in finance charges, which reached SAR 607 \\nmillion in 2022 due to the increase in interest rates. \\nThrough our completion of the 3 year GAIN strategy, we \\nachieved our 2022 goals of optimizing costs, differentiating \\nthrough innovative products and services, enhancing \\nour partnership agile operating model and building new \\nrevenue streams. Large government projects, a favorable \\nregulatory environment, and the Kingdom’s reopening to \\ntourism also positively impacted our growth. \\nRevenues were robust this year, rising by 5.6% from SAR \\n14.8 billion in 2021 to SAR 15.7 billion in 2022.

This was driven by \\ntopline performance along with managing our operations \\nefficiently. \\nThe efficiency, along with continuous investment in \\ndigitalization and our solid track record of customer \\nexperience excellence, strengthened our EBITDA margin \\nto reach 39.3%, an improvement of 1.7% compared to our \\nmargin of 37.6% the previous year. We successfully managed the impact of rising interest rates \\nand continued our ongoing deleveraging strategy this year \\nto reduce our debt portfolio to pay off more than SAR 1.2 \\nbillion of our debt balance. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio \\ncontinued to tail-off in a stellar manner to reach 1.66x at \\nthe end of 2022, compared to 2.17x at the end of 2021. \\nCAPEX was almost flat in 2022, increasing by 0.1% to reach \\nSAR 2.1 billion compared to 2021. This was consistent with \\nMobily’s strategy to invest in digital transformation and \\nproduct and service innovation. The focus this year was \\non expanding our 5G and network coverage; investing in \\ncloud, IoT, and data centers; launching and growing Mobily \\nPay; as well as automating and digitizing our operations. \\nWe continued to invest for the future, with a healthy and \\nbalanced capital structure and high return on investment. \\nNotably, the ratio of CAPEX to revenue stood at 13.4% in \\n2022, compared to 14.1% in 2021. \\nMobily’s cash position continued to improve due to solid \\nEBITDA growth.

In particular:\\n• Assessing the appropriateness of the revenue recognition \\npolicy that is applied to different products and combination \\nof products to assess whether it is in accordance with the \\napplicable accounting framework;\\n• Assessing, with the assistance of our specific team members \\nfrom IT, the design, implementation and operating \\neffectiveness of management’s key internal controls over \\nthe IT environment in which the business systems operate, \\nincluding access controls, program change controls, \\nprogram development controls and IT operation controls;\\n• Assessing with the assistance of our specific team members \\nfrom IT, the design, implementation and operating \\neffectiveness of management’s key internal IT controls over \\nthe completeness and accuracy of rating and bill generation \\nand the end to end reconciliation controls from the rating \\nand billing systems to the accounting system;\\n• Performing tests on the accuracy of customer invoice \\ngeneration on a sample basis and testing the credits and \\ndiscounts applied;\\n• Performing analytical reviews of significant revenue \\nstreams;\\n• Performing specific procedures to test the completeness \\nand accuracy of adjustments relating to contracts \\ncontaining multiple performance obligations.Capitalisation of assets and the assessment of useful lives and residual values for \\nProperty and equipment\\nSee Note 5.6 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\\nThe key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit\\nProperty and equipment represent a significant proportion of \\nthe Group’s asset base. The estimates and assumptions made \\nto determine the carrying amounts, including whether and when \\nto capitalise or expense certain costs, and the determination of \\ndepreciation charges are material to the Group’s financial position \\nand performance. The charges in respect of periodic depreciation \\nare derived after estimating an asset’s expected useful life and \\nthe expected residual value. Changes to assets’ carrying amounts, \\nexpected useful lives or residual values could result in a material \\nimpact on the consolidated financial statements and is a matter of \\nsignificance to our audit. \\nThe details of critical accounting judgments and carrying values of \\nProperty and equipment are given in Notes 6.6 and 7.\\nWe considered the valuation of Property and equipment to be a \\nkey audit matter due to the extent of judgment and assumptions \\ninvolved in the assessment of useful lives and residual values.We obtained an understanding of and tested the relevant \\nmanagement controls relating to the capitalisation of Property \\nand equipment. \\nWe evaluated the capitalisation policies and assessed the \\ntimeliness of the transfer of assets under construction by \\nagreeing the date that depreciation commenced to the date \\nthat the asset is ready for use. \\nOur substantive testing of the determination of estimated useful \\nlives and residual values included the following:\\n• Considering management’s judgments, including the \\nappropriateness of the useful life assumptions and residual \\nvalues applied in the calculation of depreciation and \\namortization. \\n• Testing on a sample basis the accuracy of the cost \\ncapitalization and capex accrual.\\n144 145\\nMOBILY ANNUAL REPORT 2022 Overview   I  Strategic Review  I  Business Review  I  ESG  I  Financial Statements', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Mobily AR_2022_English (1).pdf', 'page': 72}), Document(page_content='Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of \\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about \\nwhether the consolidated financial statements as a whole \\nare free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud \\nor error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our \\nopinion. ‘Reasonable assurance’ is a high level of assurance, \\nbut is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance \\nwith International Standards on Auditing that are endorsed \\nin the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, will always detect a material \\nmisstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from \\nfraud or error and are considered material if, individually or \\nin aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence \\nthe economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these \\nconsolidated financial statements.\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with International \\nStandards on Auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom \\nof Saudi Arabia, we exercise professional judgment and \\nmaintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We \\nalso:\\n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement \\nof the consolidated financial statements, whether due \\nto fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures \\nresponsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence \\nthat is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis \\nfor our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material \\nmisstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for \\none resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, \\nforgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the \\noverride of internal control.\\n• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to \\nthe audit in order to design audit procedures that are \\nappropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose \\nof expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the \\nGroup’s internal control.\\n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used \\nand the reasonableness of accounting estimates and \\nrelated disclosures made by management.\\n• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use \\nof the going concern basis of accounting and, based \\non the audit evidence obtained, whether a material \\nuncertainty exists related to events or conditions \\nthat may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability \\nto continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a \\nmaterial uncertainty exists, then we are required to draw \\nattention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures \\nin the consolidated financial statements or, if such \\ndisclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up \\nto the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events \\nor conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue \\nas a going concern.\\n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content \\nof the consolidated financial statements, including the \\ndisclosures, and whether the consolidated financial \\nstatements represent the underlying transactions and \\nevents in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\\n• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding \\nthe financial information of the entities or business \\nactivities within the Group to express an opinion on the \\nconsolidated financial statements. We are responsible for \\nthe direction, supervision and performance of the group \\naudit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\\nWe communicate with those charged with governance \\nregarding, among other matters, the planned scope and \\ntiming of the audit and significant audit findings, including \\nany significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify \\nduring our audit of Etihad Etisalat Company (“the Company”) \\nand its subsidiaries (“the Group”).\\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a \\nstatement that we have complied with relevant ethical \\nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate \\nwith them all relationships and other matters that may \\nreasonably be thought to bear on our independence and \\nwhere applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or \\nsafeguards applied.\\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with \\ngovernance, we determine those matters that were of \\nmost significance in the audit of the consolidated financial \\nstatements of the current period and are therefore the key \\naudit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s \\nreport unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure \\nabout the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, \\nwe determine that a matter

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation \\nof these consolidated financial statements have been \\nconsistently applied to all periods presented.\\n2.2  Basis of measurement\\nThese consolidated financial statements have been \\nprepared on historical cost basis unless stated otherwise \\nusing the going concern basis of assumption.\\n2.3  Functional and presentation currency\\nThese consolidated financial statements are presented in \\nSaudi Riyal (“SR”) which is the Group’s functional currency. \\nAll amounts have been rounded off to the nearest thousand \\nSaudi Riyal unless otherwise stated.\\n3  BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\\nControl is achieved when the Group has:\\n• Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it \\nthe current ability to direct the relevant activities of the \\ninvestee);\\n• Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its \\ninvolvement in the investee;\\n• The ability to use its power over the investee to affect \\nits returns.\\nGenerally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting \\nrights results in control. To support this presumption and \\nwhen the Group has less than a majority of the voting \\nor similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all \\nrelevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including the contractual \\narrangement(s) with the other vote holders of the investee, \\nrights arising from other contractual arrangements and the \\nGroup’s voting rights and potential voting rights.\\nThe Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an \\ninvestee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are \\nchanges to one or more of the three elements of control. \\nConsolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group \\nobtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the \\nGroup loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, \\nincome and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed \\nof during the year are included in the consolidated financial \\nstatements from the date the Group gains control until the \\ndate the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.\\nProfit or loss and each component of other comprehensive \\nincome (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the \\nGroup and to the non-controlling interests, even if this \\nresults in the non-controlling interests having a deficit \\nbalance. \\nWhen necessary, adjustments are made to the financial \\nstatements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies \\nin line with the Group’s accounting policies. All intra-group \\nassets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and cash \\nflows relating to transactions are eliminated in full on \\nconsolidation.\\nNon-controlling interest are measured at their \\nproportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net \\nassets at the date of acquisition.A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a \\nloss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. \\nIf the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:\\n• De-recognizes the assets (including goodwill) and \\nliabilities of the subsidiary;\\n• De-recognizes the carrying amount of any non-\\ncontrolling interest;\\n• De-recognizes the cumulative translation differences, \\nrecorded in equity;\\n• Recognizes the fair value of the consideration received;\\n• Recognizes the fair value of any investment retained;\\n• Recognizes any surplus or deficit in consolidated \\nstatement of profit or loss;\\n• Reclassifies the Group’s share of components previously \\nrecognized in consolidated statement of other \\ncomprehensive income to consolidated statement of \\nprofit or loss or retained earnings, as appropriate, as \\nwould be required if the Group had directly disposed of \\nthe related assets or liabilities.\\n4  NEW STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS \\nAND AMENDMENTS \\nThe standards and amendments that are issued, but not yet \\neffective, as of 31 December 2022 are disclosed below.

Acquisition related costs are \\ngenerally recognized in the consolidated statement of \\nprofit or loss as incurred.\\nWhen the Group acquires a business, it assesses the \\nfinancial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate \\nclassification and designation in accordance with the \\ncontractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent \\nconditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the \\nseparation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by \\nthe acquiree.\\nAny contingent consideration to be transferred is \\nrecognized at fair value at the acquisition date. All \\ncontingent consideration (except that which is classified as \\nequity) is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date \\nwith the changes in fair value recognized in consolidated \\nstatement of profit or loss. Contingent consideration that \\nis classified as equity is not remeasured and subsequent \\nsettlement is accounted for within equity.\\nGoodwill is initially measured as the excess of the sum of \\nthe consideration transferred, the amount of any non-\\ncontrolling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value \\nat the acquisition-date of the acquirer’s previously held \\nequity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets \\nacquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after reassessment, \\nthe net of the acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable \\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum \\nof the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-\\ncontrolling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the \\nacquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), \\nthe Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified \\nall of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed \\nand reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts \\nrecognized at the acquisition date.\\nIf the reassessment still results in an excess of the \\nfair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate \\nconsideration transferred, then a gain on bargain purchase \\nat a differential price is recognized in the consolidated \\nstatement of profit or loss.\\nAfter initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost \\nless accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose \\nof impairment testing for goodwill acquired from the \\nbusiness combination and from the date of acquisition, it \\nwill be allocated to cash-generating units (“CGU”) that are \\nexpected to benefit from the consolidation regardless of \\nwhether the other assets or liabilities acquired have been \\nallocated to those units. \\nIf goodwill is not allocated to designated cash-generating \\nunits because of an incomplete initial calculation, \\nthe initial impairment loss will not be tested unless \\nimpairment indicators are available to enable the Group \\nto distribute the carrying amount of the goodwill to the \\ncash generating units or the group of cash generating \\nunits expected to benefit from business combination. \\nWhere goodwill is allocated to the cash generating unit \\nand part of the operations of that unit are disposed of, \\ngoodwill associated with the discontinued operation will be \\nincluded in the carrying amount when determining the gain \\nor loss on disposal of the operation. The goodwill in such \\ncircumstances is measured on the basis of the value of a \\nsimilar disposed operation and the remaining portion of the \\ncash-generating unit.\\nImpairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the \\nrecoverable amount of each CGU (or group of CGUs) to \\nwhich the goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of \\nthe CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss \\nis recognized. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot \\nbe reversed in future periods.Non-controlling interests that are present ownership \\ninterests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share \\nof the entity’s net assets in the event of liquidation may \\nbe initially measured either at fair value or at the non-\\ncontrolling interests’ proportionate share of the recognized \\namounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The \\nchoice of measurement basis is made on a transaction-by-\\ntransaction basis. Other types of non-controlling interests \\nare measured at fair value or, when applicable, on the basis \\nspecified in another relevant IFRS approved in Kingdom.\\nAny contingent consideration to be paid (if any) will \\nbe recognized at fair value at the acquisition date and \\nclassified as equity or a financial liability. Contingent \\nconsideration classified as a financial liability is \\nsubsequently remeasured at fair value with the changes \\nin fair value recognized in the consolidated statement \\nof profit or loss. Contingent consideration classified as \\nequity is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement is \\naccounted for within equity.\\nWhen a business combination is achieved in stages, the \\nGroup’s previously held equity interest in the acquire \\nis remeasured to its acquisition-date fair value and \\nthe resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the \\nconsolidated statement of profit or loss. Amounts arising \\nfrom interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition \\ndate that have previously been recognized in other \\ncomprehensive income are reclassified to the consolidated \\nstatement of profit or loss where such treatment would be \\nappropriate if that interest were disposed of.\\nIf the initial accounting for the business combination is \\nnot completed by the end of the reporting period which \\nconstitutes the period in which the combination occurred, \\nthe Group presents the items whose value calculation \\nhas not been completed in a temporary manner in the \\nconsolidated financial statements. During the measurement \\nperiod, which is not more than one year from the acquisition \\ndate, the temporary value recognized on the acquisition \\ndate is retroactively adjusted to reflect the information \\nobtained about the facts and circumstances that existed at \\nthe date of acquisition and if it is determined that this will \\naffect the measurement of amounts recognized as of that \\ndate.\\nThe Group recognizes additional assets or liabilities during \\nthe measurement period if new information becomes \\navailable about facts or circumstances that existed at the date of the acquisition and if it will result in recognition of \\nassets or liabilities from that date. The measurement period \\nends once the group obtains all information that existed at \\nthe acquisition date or as soon as it becomes sure of the \\nabsence of more information.\\n5.3  Investment in an associate and a joint \\nventure \\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has \\nsignificant influence but does not have control or joint \\ncontrol over. Significant influence is the Group’s ability to \\nparticipate in the financial and operating policy decisions \\nof the investee, but not control or jointly control over those \\npolicies.\\nA joint venture is joint arrangement whereby the Group \\nhas joint control of the arrangement and has rights to the \\nnet assets of the joint arrangement. Joint control is the \\ncontractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, \\nwhich exists only when decisions about the relevant \\nactivities require the unanimous consent of the governing \\nbody of the investee.\\nFactors to determine significant influence include \\nholding directly or indirectly voting power of the \\ninvestee, representation on the board of directors or \\nequivalent governing body of the investee, participation \\nin policymaking processes including participation in \\ndecisions about dividends or other distributions, material \\ntransactions between the entity and the investee, \\ninterchange of managerial personnel or provision of \\nessential technical information.\\nThe investment in associates or joint ventures are \\naccounted for in the consolidated financial statements \\nof the Group using the equity method of accounting. \\nThe investment in associates or joint ventures in the \\nconsolidated statement of financial position are initially \\nrecognized at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize \\nthe Group’s share of the profit and loss and other \\ncomprehensive income of the associate or joint venture \\nadjusted for any impairment in the value of the net \\ninvestment. In addition, when there has been a change \\nrecognized directly in the equity of the associate or joint \\nventure, the Group recognizes its share of any changes, \\nwhen applicable, in the consolidated statement of changes \\nin equity. When the Group’s share of losses of an associate \\nor a joint venture exceeds the Group’s interest in that \\nassociate or joint venture (which includes any long-term \\n156 157\\nMOBILY ANNUAL REPORT 2022 Overview   I  Strategic Review  I  Business Review  I  ESG  I  Financial Statements', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Mobily AR_2022_English (1).pdf', 'page': 78}), Document(page_content='Etihad Etisalat Company (A Saudi Joint Stock Company)\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  \\nFor the year ended 31 December 2022\\n(ALL AMOUNTS IN SAUDI RIYALS THOUSANDS UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED)interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net \\ninvestment in the associate or joint venture), the Group \\ndiscontinues recognizing its share of further losses.\\nAdditional losses are recognized and recorded as liabilities \\nonly to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or \\nconstructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the \\nassociate or joint venture.\\nUnrealized gain or losses resulting from transactions \\nbetween the Group and the associate or joint venture are \\neliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate or \\njoint venture.\\nAn investment in an associate or a joint venture is \\naccounted for using the equity method from the date on \\nwhich the investee becomes an associate or a joint venture.\\nOn acquisition of the investment in an associate or a joint \\nventure, any excess of the cost of the investment over \\nthe Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable \\nassets and liabilities of the investee is recognized as \\ngoodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the \\ninvestment.\\nAny excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of \\nthe identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the \\ninvestment, after reassessment, is recognized immediately \\nin the consolidated statement of profit or loss in the \\nacquisition year.\\nThe Group discontinues the use of the equity method from \\nthe date when the investment ceases to be an associate or \\na joint venture, or when the investment is classified as held \\nfor sale.\\nWhen the Group reduces its ownership interest in an \\nassociate or a joint venture but the Group continues \\nto use the equity method, the Group reclassifies to the \\nconsolidated statement of profit or loss the gain or loss that \\nhad previously been recognized in other comprehensive \\nincome relating to that reduction in ownership interest if \\nthat gain or loss includes the disposal of the related assets \\nor liabilities.\\nWhen any entity within the Group transacts with an \\nassociate or a joint venture of the Group, profits and losses \\nresulting from the transactions with the associate or joint \\nventure are recognized in the Group’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in the associate \\nor joint venture that are not related to the Group.\\n5.4  Cash and cash equivalents\\nCash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement \\nof financial position comprise cash at banks and short term \\nmurabahas with a maturity of three months or less, which \\nare subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.  \\n5.5  Financial instruments – initial recognition, \\nsubsequent measurement and derecognition\\n5.5.1  Financial assets\\n5.5.1.1   Recognition and initial measurement\\nA financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a \\nsignificant financing component that is initially measured \\nat the transaction price) is initially measured at fair value \\n– for items that are not recognized at fair value through \\nprofit and loss – plus the transaction costs that contributed \\ndirectly to its acquisition. \\n5.5.1.2  Classification and subsequent measurement\\nOn initial recognition, financial assets are classified as \\nmeasured at: amortized cost; Fair Value through Other \\nComprehensive Income (FVOCI) – debt investment; FVOCI \\n– equity investment; or Fair Value through Profit and Loss \\n(FVTPL).\\nThe classification of financial assets under IFRS 9 \\nis generally based on the business model in which a \\nfinancial asset is managed and its contractual cash flow \\ncharacteristics. \\nA financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets \\nboth of the following conditions and is not designated as at \\nFVTPL: \\n• It is held within a business model whose objective is to \\nhold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and \\n• Its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash \\nflows that are solely payments of principal and interest \\non the principal amount outstanding.\\nA debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of \\nthe following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL: \\n • It is held within a business model whose objective is \\nachieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and \\nselling financial assets; and \\n• Its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash \\nflows that are solely payments of principal and interest \\non the principal amount outstanding.\\nOn initial recognition of an equity investment that is not \\nheld for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present \\nsubsequent changes in the investment’s fair value in OCI. \\nThis election is made on an investment-by-investment \\nbasis.All financial assets not classified as measured at amortized \\ncost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. \\nThis includes all derivative financial assets. On initial \\nrecognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a \\nfinancial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to \\nbe measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if \\ndoing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting \\nmismatch that would otherwise arise.\\nThe subsequent measurement of financial assets depends \\non their classification, as described below:\\n5.5.1.3  Derecognition\\nA financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial \\nasset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is \\nprimarily derecognised when:\\n• The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have \\nexpired; or\\n• The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash \\nflows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to \\npay the received cash flows in full without material delay \\nto a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; \\nand either:\\n(i) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks \\nand rewards of the asset, or \\n(ii) the Group has neither transferred nor retained \\nsubstantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, \\nbut has transferred control of the asset.5.5.1.4   Impairment of financial assets\\nThe Group recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit \\nlosses (ECL) on debt instruments that are measured at \\namortized cost or at FVOCI, accounts receivable, contract \\nassets, lease receivables and financial guarantee contracts. \\nNo impairment loss is recognized for investments in \\nequity instruments. The amount of expected credit losses \\nreflects changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the \\nrespective financial instrument.\\nThe Group applies the simplified approach to calculate \\nimpairment on accounts receivable and contract assets \\nand this always recognizes lifetime ECL on such exposures. \\nECL on these financial assets are estimated using a flow \\nrate based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, \\nadjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors, \\ngeneral economic conditions and an assessment of both \\nthe current as well as the forecast direction of conditions \\nat the reporting date, including time value of money where \\nappropriate. Financial assets at amortized cost These assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest \\nmethod. The amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign \\nexchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in consolidated statement of \\nprofit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognized in consolidated statement of \\nprofit or loss. \\nFinancial assets at FVOCI - Debt \\ninvestments These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the \\neffective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized \\nin consolidated statement of profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognized in \\nconsolidated statement of comprehensive income. On derecognition, gains and losses \\naccumulated in consolidated statement of comprehensive income are reclassified to \\nconsolidated statement of profit or loss. \\nFinancial assets at FVOCI - Equity \\ninvestmentsThese assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as income in \\nconsolidated statement of profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of \\npart of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognized in consolidated \\nstatement of comprehensive income and are never reclassified to consolidated statement of \\nprofit or loss.\\nFinancial assets at FVTPL These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any \\ninterest or dividend income, are recognized in consolidated statement of profit or loss. \\n158 159\\nMOBILY ANNUAL REPORT 2022 Overview   I  Strategic Review  I  Business Review  I  ESG  I  Financial Statements', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Mobily AR_2022_English (1).pdf', 'page': 79}), Document(page_content='Etihad Etisalat Company (A Saudi Joint Stock Company)\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  \\nFor the year ended 31 December 2022\\n(ALL AMOUNTS IN SAUDI RIYALS THOUSANDS UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED)For all other financial instruments, the Group applies the \\ngeneral approach to calculate impairment. Lifetime ECL \\nis recognized when there has been a significant increase \\nin credit risk since initial recognition and 12-month ECL is \\nrecognized when the credit risk on the financial instrument \\nhas not increased significantly since initial recognition. \\nThe assessment of whether credit risk of the financial \\ninstrument has increased significantly since initial \\nrecognition is made through considering the change in risk \\nof default occurring over the remaining life of the financial \\ninstrument.\\nIn assessing whether the credit risk on a financial \\ninstrument has increased significantly since initial \\nrecognition, the Group compares the risk of a default \\noccurring on the financial instrument as at the end of the \\nreporting period with the risk of a default occurring on the \\nfinancial instrument as at the date of initial recognition. \\nIn making this assessment, the Group considers both \\nquantitative and qualitative information that is reasonable \\nand supportable, including historical experience and \\nforward-looking information that is available. \\nThe Group considers the default in case of accounts \\nreceivable occurs when a customer balance moves into the \\n“Inactive” category based on its debt age analysis. \\nFor all other financial assets, the Group considers the \\nfollowing as constituting an event of default as historical \\nexperience indicates that receivables that meet either of \\nthe following criteria are generally not recoverable: \\n• when there is a breach of financial covenants by the \\ncounterparty; or \\n• information developed internally or obtained from \\nexternal sources indicates that the debtor is unlikely to \\npay his dues.\\nThe Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial \\ninstrument has not increased significantly since initial \\nrecognition if the financial instrument is determined to \\nhave low credit risk at the reporting date. A financial \\ninstrument is determined to have low credit risk if; i) \\nthe financial instrument has a low risk of default, ii) the \\nborrower has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash \\nflow obligations in the near term and iii) adverse changes in \\neconomic and business conditions in the longer term may, \\nbut will not necessarily, reduce the ability of the borrower to \\nfulfill its contractual cash flow obligations. The measurement of expected credit losses is a function \\nof the probability of default, loss given default (i.e. the \\npercentage of the loss if there is a default) and the \\nexposure at default. The assessment of the probability of \\ndefault is based on historical data adjusted by forward-\\nlooking information.\\nThe Group recognizes an impairment loss or reversals in \\nthe consolidated statement of profit or loss for all financial \\ninstruments with a corresponding adjustment to their \\ncarrying amount through a loss allowance account, except \\nfor investments in debt instruments that are measured \\nat FVOCI, for which the loss allowance is recognized in \\nconsolidated statement of comprehensive income and \\naccumulated in the investment revaluation reserve, and \\ndoes not reduce the carrying amount of the financial asset \\nin the consolidated statement of financial position.\\n5.5.2 Financial liabilities\\n5.5.2.1   Recognition and measurement\\nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, \\nas measured at amortized cost or financial liabilities at \\nfair value through profit or loss. All financial liabilities \\nother than financial liabilities at fair value through profit \\nor loss are recognized initially at fair value net of directly \\nattributable transaction costs. Financial liabilities at fair \\nvalue through profit or loss are measured initially and \\nsubsequently at fair value, and any related transaction \\ncosts are recognised in consolidated statement of profit or \\nloss as incurred. \\n5.5.3 Derivatives\\nDerivatives are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent \\nto initial recognition, any change in fair value is generally \\nrecognized in consolidated statement of profit or loss.\\nThe Group designates derivatives as hedging instruments \\nto hedge the variability in cash flows associated with highly \\nprobable forecast transactions arising from changes in \\nprofit rates.\\nHedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of \\nthe hedge relationship and periodically to ensure that an \\neconomic relationship exists between the hedged item \\nand hedging instrument. The Group enters into hedge \\nrelationships where the critical terms of the hedging \\ninstrument match exactly with the terms of the hedged \\nitem.At the inception of designated hedging relationships, \\nthe Group documents the risk management objective \\nand strategy for undertaking the hedge. The Group also \\ndocuments the economic relationship between the hedged \\nitem and the hedging instrument, including whether the \\nchanges in cash flows of the hedged item and hedging \\ninstrument are expected to offset each other.\\nWhen a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging \\ninstrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair \\nvalue of the derivative is recognized in consolidated \\nstatement of comprehensive income and accumulated \\nin the hedging reserve shown in shareholders’ equity. \\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of the \\nderivative that is recognized in consolidated statement of \\ncomprehensive income is limited to the cumulative change \\nin fair value of the hedged item, \\ndetermined on a present value basis, from inception of the \\nhedge.

The effect of \\nsuch changes is recognized in the consolidated statements \\nof profit or loss prospectively.\\n5.7 Intangible Assets\\nIntangible assets are presented in the consolidated \\nstatement of financial position at cost less accumulated \\namortization and accumulated impairment losses. The cost \\nof intangible assets acquired in a business combination \\nrepresents their fair value as at the date of acquisition. The \\nuseful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite \\nor indefinite. Intangible assets with finite life are amortized \\nover the useful economic life and the estimated useful life \\nand amortization method are reviewed at the end of each \\nfinancial year, with the effect of any changes in estimate \\nbeing accounted for on a prospective basis.\\nIntangible assets with indefinite life are not amortized, \\nbut are tested for impairment annually. The assessment of \\nindefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether \\nthe indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the \\nchange in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a \\nprospective basis. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalized \\ndevelopment costs, are not capitalized and expenditure is \\nrecognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in \\nthe period in which the expenditure is incurred.\\n5.7.1  License and frequency spectrum fees \\nAcquired telecommunication licenses are initially recorded \\nat cost or, if part of a business combination, at fair value.\\nAmortization periods for license and frequency spectrum \\nfees are determined primarily by reference to the unexpired \\nlicense period, the conditions for license renewal and \\nwhether licenses are dependent on specific technologies. \\nAmortization is charged to the consolidated statement of \\nprofit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated \\nuseful lives when the related network services are available \\nfor use.\\n5.7.2  Goodwill \\nGoodwill is the amount that results when the fair value of \\nconsideration transferred for an acquired business exceeds \\nthe net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and \\ncontingent liabilities recognized. When the Group enters \\ninto a business combination, the acquisition method of \\naccounting is used. Goodwill is assigned, as of the date of \\nthe business combination, to cash generating units that \\nare expected to benefit from the business combination. \\nEach cash generating unit represents the lowest level at \\nwhich goodwill is monitored and evaluated for internal \\nmanagement purposes and it is never larger than an \\noperating segment.\\n5.7.3  Indefeasible rights of use “IRU”\\nIRUs correspond to the right to use a portion of the capacity \\nof a terrestrial or submarine transmission cable granted \\nfor a fixed period. IRUs are recognized at cost as an asset \\nwhen the Group has the specific indefeasible right to use an \\nidentified portion of the underlying asset, generally optical \\nfibers or dedicated wavelength bandwidth, and the duration \\nof the right is for the major part of the underlying asset’s \\neconomic life. They are amortized on a straight line basis \\nover the shorter of the expected period of use and the life \\nof the contract.\\n5.7.4  Computer Software\\nComputer software licenses are capitalized based on the \\ncost incurred to acquire the specific software and bring \\nit into use. Amortization is charged to the consolidated \\nstatement of profit or loss on a straight line basis over the \\nestimated useful life from the date the software is available \\nfor use.5.7.5  Derecognition of intangible assets\\nAn intangible asset is derecognized on disposal, or when \\nno future economic benefits are expected from its use or \\non disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of \\nan intangible asset, measured as the difference between \\nthe net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the \\nasset, are recognized in the consolidated statement of \\nprofit or loss.\\n5.8  Borrowing Costs\\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, \\nconstruction or production of an asset that necessarily \\ntakes a substantial period of time to get ready for its \\nintended use or sale are capitalized as part of the cost of \\nthe respective asset. Where funds are borrowed specifically \\nto finance a project, the amount capitalized represents \\nthe actual borrowing costs incurred. Where surplus funds \\nare available for a short term from money borrowed \\nspecifically to finance a project, the income generated from \\nthe temporary investment of such amounts is deducted \\nfrom the total capitalized borrowing cost. Where the funds \\nused to finance a project form part of general borrowings, \\nthe amount capitalized is calculated using an applicable \\nweighted average rate.\\nAll other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in \\nwhich they incurred. Borrowing costs consist of interest \\nand other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the \\nborrowing of funds.\\n5.9  Impairment of non-financial assets\\nThe Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether \\nthere is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If \\nany indication exists, or when annual impairment testing \\nfor an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s \\nrecoverable amount. Asset’s recoverable amount is the \\nhigher of an asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal \\nand its value in use. The recoverable amount is determined \\nfor an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate \\ncash inflows that are largely independent of those from \\nother assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount \\nof an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the \\nasset is considered impaired and is written down to its \\nrecoverable amount.\\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows \\nare discounted to their present value using a pre-tax \\ndiscount rate that reflects current market assessments of \\nthe time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent \\nmarket transactions are taken into account. If no such \\ntransactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation \\nmodel is used. \\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment and any \\nimpairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. \\nImpairment losses are recognized in the consolidated \\nstatement of profit or loss in expense categories consistent \\nwith the function of the impaired asset.\\nFor assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made \\nat each reporting date to determine whether there is an \\nindication that previously recognized impairment losses no \\nlonger exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the \\nGroup estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. \\nThe reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the \\nasset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed \\nthe carrying amount that would have been determined, net \\nof depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized \\nfor the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognized in \\nthe consolidated statement of profit or loss.\\n5.10 Zakat and tax\\nThe Group calculates zakat in accordance with the \\nregulations of the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority \\n(ZATCA). Provision for zakat for the Group is charged \\nto the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Foreign \\nsubsidiaries are subject to income taxes in their respective \\ncountries of domicile. Such income taxes are charged to the \\nconsolidated statement of profit or loss.\\nThe Company and its Saudi Arabian subsidiaries withhold \\ntaxes on certain transactions with non-resident parties \\nin the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as required under Saudi \\nArabian Income Tax Law.\\nThe Group is subject to VAT as per the regulations of ZATCA. \\nThe net VAT amount recoverable from and/ due to the \\nZATCA is included in the consolidated statement of financial \\nposition.\\nAdjustments resulting from final assessments, if any, are \\nrecorded during the period in which these assessments are \\napproved.\\n162 163\\nMOBILY ANNUAL REPORT 2022 Overview   I  Strategic Review  I  Business Review  I  ESG  I  Financial Statements', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Mobily AR_2022_English (1).pdf', 'page': 81}), Document(page_content='Etihad Etisalat Company (A Saudi Joint Stock Company)\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  \\nFor the year ended 31 December 2022\\n(ALL AMOUNTS IN SAUDI RIYALS THOUSANDS UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED)5.11  Employee termination benefits\\n5.11.1  Retirement benefit costs and end of service \\nbenefits\\nPayments to defined contribution schemes are charged \\nas an expense as they fall due.

The provision \\nis recognized based on the present value of the defined \\nbenefit obligations.\\nThe present value of the defined benefit obligations \\nis calculated using assumptions on the average salary \\nincremental rate, average employees’ years of service and \\nan appropriate discount rate. The assumptions used are \\ncalculated on a consistent basis for each period and reflect \\nmanagement’s best estimate.\\nRemeasurement of net liabilities that includes actuarial \\ngains and losses arising from the changes in assumptions \\nused in the calculation, is recognized directly in other \\ncomprehensive income. Remeasurements are not \\nreclassified to the consolidated statement of profit and loss \\nin subsequent periods. \\nPast service cost is recognized in consolidated statement of \\nprofit or loss on the earlier of:\\n• The date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and\\n• The date the Group recognizes related restructuring \\ncosts.\\nNet interest cost is calculated using the discount rate to net \\ndefined benefit assets or liabilities. The Group recognizes \\nthe following changes in the net benefit obligation \\nidentified in the consolidated statement of profit or loss:\\n• Service costs that include the current service costs, past \\nservice costs, profits and losses resulting from labour \\ndownsizing and non-routine payments.\\n• Net finance cost.5.11.2  Other short and long-term employee \\nbenefits\\nA liability is recognized for benefits accruing to employees \\nin respect of wages and salaries, annual leave and sick \\nleave in the period in which the related service is rendered \\nat the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be \\npaid in exchange for that service. Liabilities recognized in \\nrespect of short-term employee benefits are measured at \\nthe undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be \\npaid in exchange for the related service.\\n5.12  Revenue\\nThe Group recognizes revenue from contracts with \\ncustomers when it transfers control over a product or \\nservices to a customer and based on the consideration \\nspecified in the contract with the customer and excludes \\namounts collected on behalf of other parties. \\nWhen there is a high degree of uncertainty about the \\npossibility of collection from certain customers, the Group \\nrecognizes revenue only upon collection.\\nThe timing of revenue recognition is either at a point in \\ntime or over time depending upon the satisfaction of the \\nperformance obligation by transferring control of goods or \\nservices to the customer.\\nThe Group mainly earns revenue from providing mobile \\ntelecommunication services and devices sale. Products and \\nservices may be sold separately or in bundled packages. \\n5.12.1  Service\\nRevenue from services comprises airtime usage, text \\nmessaging, data service (fixed and mobile internet) and \\nother telecom services. The Group offers services in fixed \\nterm contracts and short-term arrangement. Revenue \\nfrom service is recognized when obligation is performed \\nor services are rendered. When services include multiple \\nperformance obligations, the Group allocates transaction \\nprice to each distinct performance obligation based \\non respective standalone selling price. The standalone \\nselling price is the observable price for which the good \\nor service is sold by the Group in similar circumstances \\nto similar customers. If performance obligations are not \\ndistinct, revenue is recognized over the contract term. In \\narrangements, where Group is acting as agent, revenue \\nfrom service is at net off amount transferred to third party. \\nRevenue from additional consumption is recognized when \\nservices are rendered.5.12.2    Devices Sale\\nRevenue from sale of devices is recognized at the point \\nin time when control of the devices is transferred to the \\ncustomer, and generally on delivery of the devices, the \\namount invoiced / collected is recognized as revenue. \\nDevices sales may be separate from or bundled with \\na service offering. The Group considers whether there \\nare other promises in the contract that are separate \\nperformance obligations to which a portion of the \\ntransaction price needs to be allocated based on respective \\nstandalone selling price. When devices sale is bundled with \\nservice offering and identified as distinct performance \\nobligation, the amount allocated to devices is recognized \\nas revenue at the point in time when control of the asset \\nis transferred to the customer. When devices sale is \\nbundled with service offering and identified as combined \\nperformance obligation, revenue is recognized over \\ncontract term.\\n5.12.3  Installation and activation services\\nRevenue from sale of SIM is recognized at the point in time \\nupon activation when end customer takes control of the \\nSIM.\\nThe Group provides installation services that are bundled \\ntogether with the sale of devices to a customer. \\nContracts for bundled sales of devices and installation \\nservices are comprised of one performance obligations \\nbecause the promises to transfer devices and provide \\ninstallation services are not capable of being distinct. \\nAccordingly, the Group recognizes revenue from bundled \\nsales of devices and installation services over time, using \\nan input method to measure progress towards complete \\nsatisfaction of the service, because the customer \\nsimultaneously receives and consumes the benefits \\nprovided by the Group. \\n5.12.4  Loyalty points program \\nCustomer loyalty scheme give rise to a separate \\nperformance obligation because it generally provides \\na material right to the customer. The Group allocates a \\nportion of the transaction price to the loyalty scheme \\nliability based on relative standalone selling price of loyalty \\npoint and liability is recognized as revenue when points are \\nredeemed or expired. 5.12.5    Service offering to carrier (wholesale)\\nInterconnect revenue is recognized on the basis of the gross \\nvalue of invoices raised on other operators for termination \\ncharges based on the airtime usage, text messaging and \\nthe provision of other mobile telecommunications services \\nfor the billing period as per the agreed rate.\\nRoaming revenue is recognized on the basis of the gross \\nvalue of invoices raised on other roaming partners based \\non actual traffic delivered during the billing period.\\nRevenue from other wholesales service is recognized on the \\nbasis of gross value over contract term.  \\n5.12.6  Determination of Transaction Price\\nWhen contract include contractual clause covering \\ncommercial discount or free offers, the Group defers these \\ndiscounts or free offers over the contract term.\\nIn determining the transaction price, the Group considers \\nthe effects of variable consideration, the existence of \\nsignificant financing components, non-cash consideration \\nand consideration payable to the customer (if any). \\n5.12.6.1 Variable consideration\\nIf the consideration in a contract includes a variable \\namount, the Group estimates the amount of consideration \\nto which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring \\nthe products to the customer. The variable consideration \\nis estimated at contract inception and constrained until \\nit is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal \\nin the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not \\noccur when the associated uncertainty with the variable \\nconsideration is subsequently resolved.\\n5.12.6.2  Significant financing component\\nIf a customer can pay for purchased equipment or services \\nover a period of time, IFRS 15 requires judgement to \\ndetermine if the contract includes a significant financing \\ncomponent. If it does, then the transaction price is adjusted \\nto reflect the time value of money. \\n5.12.6.3 Non-cash consideration\\nThe fair value of non-cash consideration received from \\nthe customer on the transaction date is included in the \\ntransaction price. \\n164 165\\nMOBILY ANNUAL REPORT 2022 Overview   I  Strategic Review  I  Business Review  I  ESG  I  Financial Statements', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Mobily AR_2022_English (1).pdf', 'page': 82}), Document(page_content='Etihad Etisalat Company (A Saudi Joint Stock Company)\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  \\nFor the year ended 31 December 2022\\n(ALL AMOUNTS IN SAUDI RIYALS THOUSANDS UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED)5.12.6.4 Consideration payable to the customer\\nConsideration payable to the customer includes cash \\namount that the Group pays or expect to pay to the \\ncustomers and is accounted for as reduction of transaction \\nprice.\\n5.13 Contract balances\\n5.13.1  Contract assets\\nContract assets are the rights to consideration in exchange \\nfor products or services transferred by the Group to the \\ncustomer.  If the Group performs by transferring products \\nor services to a customer before the customer pays \\nconsideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is \\nrecognized for the earned consideration that is conditional.\\n5.13.2  Contract costs\\nContract costs relate to incremental costs of obtaining \\na contract and certain costs to fulfil a contract to be \\nrecognized as an asset when:\\n• The costs relate directly to the contract (or to a \\nspecified anticipated contract)\\n• The costs generate or enhance resources of the Group \\nthat will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy) \\nperformance obligations in the future.\\n• The costs are expected to be recovered\\nContract costs recognized by the Group are amortized on a \\nsystematic basis that is consistent with the Group’s transfer \\nof related goods or services to the customer.\\n5.13.3  Contract liabilities\\nContract liabilities are recognized if a payment is received \\nor a payment is due (whichever is earlier) from a customer \\nbefore the Group transfers the related products or services. \\nContract liabilities are recognized as revenue when the \\nGroup performs under the contract (i.e. transfers control of \\nthe related products or services to the customer). \\n5.14  Costs and expenses\\n5.14.1    Cost of revenue\\nRepresent the cost of revenue incurred during the period \\nwhich include the costs of products sold, inventory \\nobsolescence, governmental charges, interconnection costs \\nand other direct and indirect costs related to the revenues \\nrecognized.5.14.1.1 Governmental charges\\nGovernmental charges represent government contribution \\nfees in trade earnings, license fees, frequency waves’ fees \\nand costs charged to the Group against the rights to use \\ntelecommunications and data services in the Kingdom of \\nSaudi Arabia as stipulated in the license agreements. These \\nfees are recorded in the related periods during which these \\nfees are incurred and included under cost of services in the \\nconsolidated statement of profit or loss.\\n5.14.1.2 Interconnection costs\\nInterconnection costs represent connection charges to \\nnational and international telecommunication networks. \\nInterconnection costs are recorded in the period when \\nrelevant calls are made and are included in the cost of \\nservices caption in the consolidated statement of profit or \\nloss.\\n5.14.2 Selling and marketing expenses\\nExpenses related to the selling, distribution and marketing \\nfunctions represents direct and indirect costs that are not \\nspecifically part of cost of revenue and are directly related \\nto sales, distribution and marketing activities.\\n5.14.3 General and administrative expenses\\nRepresent expenses related to the administration and \\nnot to the revenue earning or the selling, distribution and \\nmarketing functions. General and administrative expenses \\ninclude direct and indirect costs that are not specifically \\npart of cost of revenue or sales and marketing expenses.\\n5.15  Dividends\\nThe Company’s dividends policy is approved by the \\nGeneral Assembly and the Company recognizes a liability \\nto pay a dividend when the distribution is authorized. A \\ncorresponding amount is recognized directly in equity.\\n5.16  Foreign currencies\\nThe financial statements and disclosures are presented \\nin Saudi Riyals (the functional currency of Etihad Etisalat \\nCompany – the Parent Company). For each subsidiary, the \\nGroup determines the functional currency, which is defined \\nas the currency of the primary economic environment \\nin which the entity operates, and items included in the \\nfinancial statements of each subsidiary are measured using \\nthat functional currency.\\nIn preparing the financial statements of each individual \\ngroup entity, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are \\nrecognized at the rates of exchange prevailing at the \\ndates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting \\nperiod, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies \\nare translated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-\\nmonetary items carried at fair value that are denominated \\nin foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing \\nat the date when the fair value was determined. The gain \\nor loss arising on translation of non-monetary items \\nmeasured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition \\nof gain or loss on change in fair value of the item to which it \\nrelates. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of \\nhistorical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.\\nGains or losses arising on settlement or translation of \\nmonetary items are recognized in profit or loss with the \\nexception of monetary items that are designated as part \\nof the hedge of the Group’s net investment in a foreign \\noperation. These are recognized in OCI until the net \\ninvestment is disposed of, at which time, the cumulative \\namount is reclassified to profit or loss. Tax charges and \\ncredits attributable to exchange differences on those \\nmonetary items are also recognized in OCI.\\nFor the purposes of presenting the consolidated financial \\nstatements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s \\nforeign operations are translated into Saudi Riyals using \\nexchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Income \\nand expense items are translated at the average exchange \\nrates for the reporting period, unless exchange rates \\nfluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the \\nexchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used. \\nExchange differences arising, if any, are recognized in other \\ncomprehensive income and accumulated in equity (and \\nattributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate).\\nAny goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign \\noperation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying \\namounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition \\nare treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation \\nand translated at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting \\ndate.\\nOn the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal \\nof the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, a \\ndisposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary that \\nincludes a foreign operation, or a partial disposal of an \\ninterest in a joint venture or an associate that includes a \\nforeign operation of which the retained interest becomes a financial asset), all of the exchange differences \\naccumulated in equity in respect of that operation \\nattributable to the Company’s shareholders are reclassified \\nto the consolidated statement of profit or loss.For all partial \\ndisposals of associates or joint ventures that do not result \\nin the Group losing significant influence or joint control, \\nthe proportionate share of the accumulated exchange \\ndifferences is reclassified to the consolidated statement of \\nprofit or loss. \\n5.17  Leases \\nThe Group assesses at inception of a contract, whether the \\ncontract is, or contains, a lease.

The Group \\ndetermines the revised discount rate as the interest rate \\nimplicit in the lease for the remainder of the lease term, \\nor, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s \\nincremental borrowing rate at the date of reassessment.\\nWhere, (a) there is a change in the amounts expected to be \\npayable under a residual value guarantee; or (b) there is a \\nchange in future lease payments resulting from a change \\nin an index or a rate used to determine those payments, \\nincluding a change to reflect changes in market rental rates \\nfollowing a market rent review, the Group re-measures the \\nlease liabilities by discounting the revised lease payments \\nusing an unchanged discount rate, unless the change in \\nlease payments results from a change in floating interest \\nrates. In such case, the Group use a revised discount rate \\nthat reflects changes in the interest rate.\\nThe Group recognizes the amount of the re-measurement \\nof lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use \\nasset.

The Group recognizes the lease payments \\nassociated with these leases as an expense on a straight-\\nline basis over the lease term.\\n5.17.2  The Group as a lessor\\nWhen the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease \\ninception whether each lease is a finance lease or an \\noperating lease.\\nTo classify each lease, the Group makes an overall \\nassessment of whether the lease transfers substantially \\nall of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the \\nunderlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a \\nfinance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part \\nof this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators \\nsuch as whether the lease is for the major part of the \\neconomic life of the asset.\\nWhen the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for \\nits interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. \\nIt assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with \\nreference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head \\nlease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head \\nlease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the \\nexemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease \\nas an operating lease.\\nThe Group recognizes lease payments received under \\noperating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the \\nlease term in consolidated statement of profit or loss.\\n5.18  Segment reporting\\nOperating segments of the Group are identified based on \\ninternal reports, which are regularly reviewed by the Group’s \\nmain decision makers (Chief Operating Decision Maker \\n“CODM”) for the purpose of resource allocation among \\nsegments and performance assessment.5.19  Provisions\\n5.19.1    General\\nProvisions are recognized when the Group has a present \\nobligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, \\nit is probable that the Group will be required to settle the \\nobligation, and the obligation can be measured reliably.\\nThe amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate \\nof the consideration required to settle the present \\nobligation at the end of the financial year, after taking \\ninto account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the \\nobligation. When a provision is measured using the cash \\nflows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying \\namount is the present value of those cash flows (when \\nthe effect of the time value of money is material). When \\ndiscounting is used, the increase in the provision due to \\nthe passage of time is recognized as a finance cost in the \\nconsolidated statement of profit or loss.\\nWhen some or all of the economic benefits required to \\nsettle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third \\nparty, a receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually \\ncertain that reimbursement will be received and the amount \\nof the receivable can be measured reliably.\\n5.19.2  Asset decommissioning liabilities\\nThe Group recognizes obligations on decommissioning \\nof assets when there is a legal or constructive obligation \\narising from past events and it is likely to result in an \\noutflow of resources to settle the obligation and if the \\nobligation can be reliably measured.\\nThe Group calculates a provision with the value of future \\ncosts related to the decommissioning of the assets. Upon \\ninitial recognition of the obligation, the present value of \\nthe expected costs (using a discount rate for future cash \\nflows) is added to the value of the right of use assets. The \\nunwinding of the discount is expensed as incurred and \\nrecognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss \\nas a finance costs. \\nThe estimated future costs of decommissioning are \\nreviewed annually and adjusted as appropriate. Changes in \\nthe estimated future costs or in the discount rate applied \\nare added to or deducted from the cost of right of use \\nassets.5.20  Contingent liabilities\\nA contingent liability is a possible obligation which may \\narise from past events and whose existence will be \\nconfirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of \\none or more uncertain future events not wholly within the \\ncontrol of the Group, or a present obligation that is not \\nrecognized because it is not probable that an outflow \\nof resources will be required to settle the obligation. If \\nthe amount of the obligation cannot be measured with \\nsufficient reliability, then the Group does not recognize \\nthe contingent liability but discloses it in the consolidated \\nfinancial statements.\\n5.21  Inventories\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable \\nvalue. Costs of inventories are determined using the \\nweighted average method. Net realizable value represents \\nthe estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated \\ncosts of completion and costs necessary to make the sale. \\nThe Group provides for slow-moving and obsolete \\ninventories in the cost of revenue in the consolidated \\nstatement of profit or loss.\\n5.22  Government grants\\nGovernment grants are not recognized until there is \\nreasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the \\nattached conditions and that the grants will be received.\\nGovernment grants are recognized in the consolidated \\nstatement of profit or loss on a systematic basis over \\nthe periods in which the Group recognizes as expenses \\nthe related costs for which the grants are intended to \\ncompensate. Specifically, government grants whose primary \\ncondition is that the Group should purchase, construct or \\notherwise acquire non-current assets are recognized as \\ndeferred revenue in the consolidated statement of financial \\nposition and transferred to the consolidated statement of \\nprofit or loss on a systematic and rational basis over the \\nuseful lives of the related assets.\\nWhen the Group receives government grants as \\ncompensation for expenses or losses already incurred or \\nimmediate financial support with no future related costs, \\nthese are recognized in the profit or loss in the period in \\nwhich they become receivable.\\n168 169\\nMOBILY ANNUAL REPORT 2022 Overview   I  Strategic Review  I  Business Review  I  ESG  I  Financial Statements', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Mobily AR_2022_English (1).pdf', 'page': 84}), Document(page_content='Etihad Etisalat Company (A Saudi Joint Stock Company)\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  \\nFor the year ended 31 December 2022\\n(ALL AMOUNTS IN SAUDI RIYALS THOUSANDS UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED)6  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, \\nASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGEMENTS\\nThe preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial \\nstatements in “prepared in accordance with IFRS as \\nendorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other \\nstandards and pronouncements issued by SOCPA” requires \\nthe use of estimates, assumptions and judgments that \\naffect the amounts recorded as revenue, expenses, assets, \\nliabilities and the accompanying disclosures, as well as \\nthe disclosure of contingent liabilities. The estimates, \\nassumptions and judgements are based on historical \\nexperience and other factors that are considered to be \\nrelevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates \\ndue to market changes or circumstances arising beyond \\nthe control of the Group, such changes are reflected in \\nthe assumptions when they occur. Uncertainty about \\nthese estimates, assumptions and judgments could result \\nin outcomes that require a material adjustment to the \\ncarrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future \\nperiods.\\nThe estimates are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions \\nto accounting estimates are recognized in the period in \\nwhich the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that \\nperiod, or in the period of the revision and future periods.\\n6.1 Provisions\\nIn respect of provisions including decommissioning \\nprovision, the Group provides for anticipated outflows \\nof resources considered probable. Estimates are used \\nin assessing the likely amount of the settlement. The \\nultimate liability may vary from the amounts provided and \\nwould be dependent on the eventual outcome. Provisions \\nare recorded by discounting the future cash flows at a \\ncurrent pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the \\nliability. The unwinding of the discount is recognized in the \\nconsolidated statement of profit or loss as a finance cost.\\n6.2  Impairment losses on trade receivables \\nand contract assets\\nThe Group uses a provision matrix to calculate expected \\ncredit loss on accounts receivable and contract assets. The \\nprovision rates are based on days past due for groupings of \\nvarious customer segments that have similar loss patterns. \\nThe provision matrix is initially based on the Group’s \\nhistorical observed default rates. The Group calibrates the \\nmatrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with \\nforward-looking information. At every reporting date, the Group updates its historical default rates and reflects that \\nin future estimates.  \\nThe assessment of the correlation between historical \\nobserved default rates, forecast economic conditions and \\nexpected credit loss is a significant estimate. The amount \\nof expected credit loss is sensitive to changes in forecast of \\ncircumstances and economic conditions. \\n6.3  Financial risk management and financial \\ninstruments\\nThe fair value of derivative instruments, investments \\nin publicly traded and private companies, and equity \\ninstruments is determined on the basis of either prices in \\nregulated markets or quoted prices provided by financial \\ncounterparties, or using valuation models which also take \\ninto account subjective measurements such as, cash flow \\nestimates or expected volatility of prices.\\n6.4  Defined benefit obligations \\nThe cost of defined benefit and the present value of \\nthe related obligation are determined using actuarial \\nvaluations. An actuarial valuation involves making various \\nassumptions which may differ from actual developments \\nin the future. These include the determination of the \\ndiscount rate, future salary increases, withdrawal rate and \\nmortality rates. Due to the complexity of the valuation, the \\nunderlying assumptions and its long-term nature, a defined \\nbenefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these \\nassumptions. \\n6.5  Impairment of non-financial assets\\nAn impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset \\nor CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the \\nhigher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value \\nin use. The fair value less costs of disposal calculation is \\nbased on available data from binding sales transactions, \\nconducted at arm’s length for similar assets or observable \\nmarket prices less incremental costs for disposing of the \\nasset. The value in use calculation is based on a discounted \\ncash flow (DCF) model. The cash flows are derived usually \\nfrom the budget for the next five years and do not include \\nrestructuring activities that the Group is not yet committed \\nto or significant future investments that will enhance \\nthe asset’s performance of the CGU being tested. The \\nrecoverable amount is most sensitive to the discount rate \\nused for the DCF model as well as the expected future \\ncash-inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation \\npurposes.6.6  Property and equipment\\n6.6.1   Useful lives of property and equipment\\nThe useful life of each of the Group’s items of property and \\nequipment is estimated based on the period over which the \\nasset is expected to be available for use. Such estimation \\nis based on a collective assessment of practices of similar \\nbusinesses, internal technical evaluation, experience with \\nsimilar assets and application of judgment as to when the \\nassets become available for use and the commencement of \\nthe depreciation.\\nThe estimated useful life of each asset is reviewed at least \\neach financial year-end and updated if expectations differ \\nfrom previous estimates due to physical wear and tear, \\ntechnical or commercial obsolescence and legal or other \\nlimits on the use of the asset. It is possible, however, that \\nfuture results of operations could be materially affected by \\nchanges in the amounts and timing of recorded expenses \\nbrought about by changes in the factors mentioned \\nabove. A reduction in the estimated useful life of any item \\nof property and equipment would increase the recorded \\noperating expenses and decrease non-current assets.\\n6.6.2   Allocation of costs\\nThe Group enters into arrangements with certain of its \\nkey suppliers which may include the provision of multiple \\nproducts and services including property and equipment, \\ninventories and maintenance and other services across \\na number of reporting periods. Such arrangements may \\ninclude the provision of free of charge assets and incentives \\nwhich enable the Group to obtain further products and \\nservices at discounted values. Management aggregates, \\nwhere appropriate, such arrangements and allocates the \\nnet cost of such an aggregation between the multiple \\nproducts and services based on its best estimate of the \\nfair value of the individual components. The cost of such \\ncomponents is capitalized or expensed according to the \\nrelevant accounting policy.\\n6.7  Zakat and taxation\\nThe Group calculates zakat, withholding tax and VAT in \\naccordance with the requirements of the Zakat, Tax and \\nCustoms Authority (ZATCA) which are subject to change \\nbased on final assessments received. The final outcome of \\nany additional amounts assessed by the ZATCA depends \\non the eventual outcome of the appeal process which the \\nGroup is entitled to submit. When the final tax outcome \\ndiffers from the amounts initially recorded, such differences could impact the consolidated statement of profit or loss in \\nthe period in which the final judgment is made.\\n  \\n6.8  Contingencies\\nThe Group is currently involved in various legal proceedings. \\nEstimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these \\nclaims, if any, have been developed in consultation with \\ninternal and external counsels handling the Group’s defense \\nin these matters and are based upon the probability of \\npotential results. The Group’s management currently \\nbelieves that these proceedings will not have a material \\neffect on the consolidated financial statements. It is \\npossible, however, that future results of operations could be \\nmaterially affected depending on the final outcome of the \\nproceedings.\\n6.9  Fair value measurement \\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an \\nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction \\nbetween market participants at the measurement date. \\nThe fair value measurement is based on the presumption \\nthat the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability \\ntakes place either:\\n• In the principal market for the asset or liability; or\\n• In the absence of a principal market, in the most \\nadvantageous market for the asset or liability.\\nThe principal or most advantageous market must be \\naccessible by the Group. The fair value of an asset or a \\nliability is measured using the assumptions that market \\nparticipants would use when pricing the asset or liability, \\nassuming that market participants act in their economic \\nbest interest.\\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes \\ninto account a market participant’s ability to generate \\neconomic benefits from the asset’s highest and best use or \\nby selling it to another market participant that would utilize \\nthe asset in its highest and best use.\\nThe Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate \\nin the circumstances and for which sufficient data are \\navailable to measure fair value, maximizing the use of \\nrelevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of \\nunobservable inputs.\\n170 171\\nMOBILY ANNUAL REPORT 2022 Overview   I  Strategic Review  I  Business Review  I  ESG  I  Financial Statements', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Mobily AR_2022_English (1).pdf', 'page': 85}), Document(page_content='Etihad Etisalat Company (A Saudi Joint Stock Company)\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  \\nFor the year ended 31 December 2022\\n(ALL AMOUNTS IN SAUDI RIYALS THOUSANDS UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED)All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured \\nor disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are \\ncategorized within the fair value hierarchy. This is described \\nas follows based on the lowest level input that is significant \\nto the fair value measurement as a whole:\\n• Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active \\nmarkets for identical assets or liabilities;\\n• Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level \\ninput that is significant to the fair value measurement is \\ndirectly or indirectly observable; and\\n• Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level \\ninput that is significant to the fair value measurement is \\nunobservable.\\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognized in the \\nconsolidated financial statements at fair value on a \\nrecurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers \\nhave occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-\\nassessing categorization (based on the lowest level input \\nthat is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) \\nat the end of each reporting period. The Group determines \\nthe policies and procedures for both recurring fair value \\nmeasurement, and for non-recurring measurement. \\nAt each reporting date, the Group analyses the movements \\nin the values of assets and liabilities which are required \\nto be re-measured or re-assessed as per the Group’s \\naccounting policies. For this analysis, the Group verifies the \\nmajor inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing \\nthe information in the valuation computation to contracts \\nand other relevant documents. The Group also compares \\nthe change in the fair value of each asset and liability with \\nrelevant external sources to determine whether the change \\nis reasonable. For the purpose of fair value disclosures, \\nthe Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities \\non the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the \\nasset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy, as \\nexplained above.\\n6.10  Revenue \\n6.10.1 Identifying performance obligations in a \\nbundled sale of devices and services\\nThe Group provides services that are either sold separately \\nor bundled together with the sale of devices to a customer. \\nThe Group analyses whether devices and services are \\ncapable of being distinct or not.6.10.2 Gross versus net presentation\\nWhen the Group sells products or services as principal, \\nrevenue and related costs are reported on a gross basis in \\nrevenue and operating cost. If the Group sells products or \\nservices as an agent, revenue is recorded on a net basis, \\nrepresenting the margin earned.\\nWhether the Group is principal or agent, depends on \\nwhether the control of products or services is transferred \\nto customers, and it has the ability to direct the use of the \\ndevices or obtain benefits from the devices or service. \\nBelow are the key criteria to determine whether the Group \\nis acting as a principal: \\n• The Group has the primary responsibility for providing \\nthe products or services to the customer or for fulfilling \\nthe order, for example by being responsible for the \\nacceptability of the products or services ordered or \\npurchased by the customer;\\n• The Group has inventory risk before or after the \\ncustomer order, during shipping or on return; and\\n• The Group has latitude in establishing prices, either \\ndirectly or indirectly, for example by providing additional \\nproducts or services.\\n6.10.3 Consideration of significant financing \\ncomponent in a contract \\nThe Group analyses significant financing component in a \\ncontract where payment terms are exceeding more than \\none year for the date of services rendered. In determining \\nthe interest to be applied to the amount of consideration, \\nthe Group uses discount rate as appropriate in the \\ncircumstances. \\n6.10.4 Determining whether the loyalty points \\nprovide material rights to customers\\nThe Group assessed whether the loyalty points provide a \\nmaterial right to the customer that needs to be accounted \\nfor as a separate performance obligation. The Group \\ndetermined that the loyalty points provide a material right \\nthat the customer would not receive without entering into \\nthe contract. The free products or services the customer \\nwould receive by exercising the loyalty points do not reflect \\nthe stand-alone selling price that a customer without an \\nexisting relationship with the Group would pay for those \\nproducts or services.6.11    Leases\\nIn determining the lease term, the Group considers all \\nrelevant facts and circumstances that create an economic \\nincentive for the lessee to exercise the option to extend the \\nlease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease. \\nThe Group revises the lease term if there is a change in the \\nnon-cancellable period of a lease.\\nThe Group cannot readily determine the interest rate \\nimplicit in a lease, therefore, it uses its incremental \\nborrowing rate (IBR) to measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of interest that the Group would have to pay to \\nborrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the \\nfunds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the \\nright-of-use asset in a similar economic environment.\\nThe Group estimates the IBR using observable inputs (such \\nas market interest rates) when available in addition to make \\ncertain entity-specific estimates.\\n• During the year ended 31 December 2022, the Group has \\ncapitalized internal technical staff costs amounting to \\nSR 178 million (31 December 2021: SR 164 million).\\n• Other assets include Leasehold improvements, Office \\nfurniture and equipment and Vehicles.\\n• The Group has reviewed the estimated useful lives and \\nresidual value of property and equipment during the \\nyear ended 31 December 2022, which resulted in change \\nin the estimate of certain items, noting that the effect \\nof these changes on actual and expected depreciation \\nexpense, was not significant.7  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\\nLand and \\nbuildingsTelecom\\nnetwork\\nequipmentComputer \\nequipment \\nand \\nsoftwareOther \\nassetsCapital work \\nin progress Total\\nCost\\nAs at 1 January 2022 1,453,250 47 ,068,971 5,317 ,539 1,215,307 59,554 55,114,621\\nAdditions 32,631 1,485,765 359,290 44,205 108,618 2,030,509\\nReclassification / Transfers  -    -    -   65 (65)  -   \\nDisposals (4,622) (129,255) (630) (7 ,798)  -   (142,305)\\nAs at 31 December 2022 1,481,259 48,425,481 5,676,199 1,251,779 168,107 57 ,002,825\\nAccumulated depreciation and \\nimpairment\\nAs at 1 January 2022 462,022 29,043,551 4,203,341 1,025,595  -   34,734,509\\nCharge for the year 56,532 2,474,658 309,929 43,697  -   2,884,816\\nDisposals (2,053) (114,010) (523) (7 ,488)  -   (124,074)\\nAs at 31 December 2022 516,501 31,404,199 4,512,747 1,061,804  -   37 ,495,251\\nNet book value as at 31 December 2022 964,758 17,021,282 1,163,452 189,975 168,107 19,507,574\\nNet book value as at 31 December 2021 991,228 18,025,420 1,114,198 189,712 59,554 20,380,112\\n172 173\\nMOBILY ANNUAL REPORT 2022 Overview   I  Strategic Review  I  Business Review  I  ESG  I  Financial Statements', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Mobily AR_2022_English (1).pdf', 'page': 86}), Document(page_content='Etihad Etisalat Company (A Saudi Joint Stock Company)\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  \\nFor the year ended 31 December 2022\\n(ALL AMOUNTS IN SAUDI RIYALS THOUSANDS UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED)8  INTANGIBLE ASSETS 9  RIGHT OF USE ASSETS\\n8.1   Goodwill\\n• The Group has tested separately recognized goodwill \\nfor impairment. The recoverable amount has been \\ndetermined based on value-in-use, using discounted \\ncash flow analysis. The cash flow projections are based \\non approved budget.\\n• The recoverable amount of the CGU as at 31 December \\n2022 amounted to SR 26,083 million (31 December \\n2021: SR 25,512 million) has been determined based on \\na value-in-use calculation using cash flow projections \\nfrom financial budgets covering a five years period. The \\npre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections \\nis 10% (31 December 2021: 10%) and cash flows beyond \\nthe five years period are extrapolated using a 1.5% \\ngrowth rate (31 December 2021: 1.5%). It was concluded \\nthat the carrying value of the goodwill has not exceeded \\nthe value-in-use. As a result of this analysis, no goodwill \\nimpairment was recognized.\\n• The calculation of value-in-use for the goodwill is most \\nsensitive to the following assumptions:\\n1.  Discount rate\\n• Discount rate represents the current market assessment \\nof the risks specific to each cash generating unit and \\ncalculation is based on the specific circumstances of \\nthe Group and its operating segments and derived \\nfrom its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) which \\nconsiders into account both debt and shareholders’ \\nequity. The cost of debt is based on the interest-\\nbearing borrowings the Group is obliged to service and segment-specific risk is incorporated. The cost of \\nshareholders’ equity is driven by the expected return \\non investment by the Group’s investors. The pre-tax \\ndiscount rate used is 10% (31 December 2021: 10%).\\n• A rise in the pre-tax discount rate beyond 12% (i.e., +2 \\n%) (31 December 2021: 12.1% (i.e., +2.1 %)) in the CGU \\nwould result in an impairment loss.\\n2.  Terminal growth rate\\n• The growth rate used does not exceed the long-term \\naverage growth rates of the entity. This rate assumed \\n1.5%  (31 December 2021: 1.5%).\\n• Management believes that the speed of technological \\nchanges and the possibility of new entrants can have a \\nsignificant impact on terminal growth rate assumptions. \\nThe effect of new entrants is not expected to have \\nan adverse impact on the forecasts, but could yield \\na reasonably possible alternative to the estimated \\nlong-term growth rate of 1.5%. A reduction to 0% (31 \\nDecember 2021: 0%) in the long-term growth rate would \\nnot result in an impairment loss.• The Group’s main leases are in respect of land and \\nbuildings which is used for base stations, sales outlets, \\noffices, warehouses and technical facilities. The lease \\nperiod ranges between 2 years to 25 years and usually \\nis for 10 years and often includes an option to renew \\nthe lease at the end of the initial lease term. The Group \\nis required to restore the premises to the condition \\nthey were at time of entering into lease. The average \\nweighted discount rate used is 5.37% (31 December \\n2021: 5.42%).\\n10  INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURE\\nThe Group holds a 25% equity interest in Sehati for \\nInformation Technology Service Company (“the Joint \\nVenture”), a limited liability Company incorporated in \\nKingdom of the Saudi Arabia. The principal activities of the \\nJoint Venture are construction, maintenance and operation of networks and computers’ software and related works, \\nimport, export and sale of telecommunications systems \\nand equipment and computer systems. The investment in \\nthe joint venture is accounted for using the equity method \\nin these consolidated financial statements.

Moreover, the Group monitors the \\nactual cash flows and seeks to match the maturity dates of \\nits financial assets and its financial liabilities.\\nThe Group seeks continuously to comply with its legal \\nobligations, including any, relating to its borrowings \\nagreements.The following represents the maturities of financial \\nliabilities at the reporting date based on undiscounted \\ncontractual cash flows:\\n29.3.3 Market risk\\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices \\nsuch as foreign exchange rates, profit rates and equity \\nprices will affect the Group’s income or the value of its \\nholdings of financial instruments. The objective of market \\nrisk management is to manage and control market risk \\nexposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing \\nthe return. \\n29.3.3.1  Currency risk\\nCurrency risk is the risk that the value of a financial \\ninstrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign \\nexchange rates. The Group’s transactions are principally in \\nSaudi Riyals and US Dollars. The Saudi Riyal is pegged to the \\nUS Dollar.\\nThe management closely and continuously monitors the \\nexchange rate fluctuations. Based on its experience and \\nmarket feedback, the management does not believe it is \\nnecessary to hedge the effect of foreign exchange risks as \\nmost of the transactions of foreign currency risk is relatively \\nlimited in the medium term. 29.3.3.2 Profit rates risk\\nProfit rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash \\nflows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of \\nchanges in market profit rates. The Group’s exposure to \\nmarket risk for changes in profit rates relates primarily \\nto the Group’s borrowings which were acquired to finance \\nworking capital requirements and capital expenditure. \\nThese borrowings are re-priced on a periodic basis and \\nexpose the Group to profit rate risk. The Group’s practice is \\nto manage its financing cost through optimizing available \\ncash and minimizing borrowings.\\nThe Group seeks to ensure that on the medium term a \\nsignificant portion of its borrowings is at a fixed rate. This is \\nachieved partly by entering into fixed rate instruments and \\npartly by borrowings at a floating rate and using profit rate \\nswaps as hedges of the variability in cash flows attributable \\nto movements in profit rates.\\nThe Group determines the existence of an economic \\nrelationship between the hedging instrument and hedged \\nitem based on the reference profit rates, tenors, re-pricing \\ndates, maturities and the notional amounts.Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities \\nmeasured at amortized cost are not significantly different \\nfrom their carrying amounts.\\nAt 31 December 2022, the Group had financial derivatives \\nagreements in place with a total notional amount of SAR \\n2,948 million designated as cash flow hedge instruments \\nto cover cash flow fluctuations arising from profit rates \\nthat are subject to prevailing market price fluctuations and \\ncategorized as level 2. \\nThese derivatives are valued using widely recognized \\nvaluation models. The Group relies on the counterparty for \\nthe valuation of these derivatives. The valuation techniques \\napplied by the counterparties include the use of forward \\npricing standard models using present value calculations \\nand mid-market valuations. Where applicable, these models \\nproject future cash flows and discount the future amounts \\nto a present value using market-based observable inputs \\nincluding interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign \\nexchange rates and forward and spot prices.\\n29.3  Risk management\\nThe Group has exposure to the following risks from its use \\nof financial instruments:\\n• Credit risk\\n• Liquidity risk\\n• Market risk\\nRisk management is carried out by the senior management \\nunder policies approved by the Board of Directors. Senior \\nmanagement identifies, evaluates and hedges, when \\nappropriate, financial risks in close co-operation with the \\nGroup’s operating units.\\n29.3.1  Credit risk\\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a \\ncustomer or counterparty fails to meet its contractual \\nobligations. The Group is exposed to credit risk principally \\nfrom Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, due \\nfrom related parties, Short term Murabaha and derivative \\nfinancial instruments.\\nThe carrying amount of financial assets represents the \\nmaximum credit exposure.Cash and cash equivalents and Short term Murabahas\\nCash and cash equivalents and Short term Murabaha \\nare held with counterparties with sound credit ratings. \\nThe Group regularly updates its cash flow and, where \\nappropriate, places any excess cash on short-term \\ninvestments with reputable financial institutions.\\nAccounts receivable\\nThe Group has established a credit policy under which credit \\nassessment is being made to check the credit worthiness of \\nmajor customers prior to signing the contracts/ accepting \\ntheir purchase orders.\\nThe receivables are shown net of allowance for impairment \\nloss on accounts receivable. The Group applies the \\nsimplified approach to calculate impairment loss on \\naccounts receivable and this always recognizes lifetime \\nECL on such exposures. ECL on these financial assets are \\nestimated using a flow rate based on the Group’s historical \\ncredit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are \\nspecific to the debtors, general economic conditions and \\nan assessment of both the current as well as the forecast \\ndirection of conditions at the reporting date, including time \\nvalue of money where appropriate. Credit and Collection \\nOperations provide inputs on the aging of financial assets \\non a periodic basis.\\nThe Group has two major customers representing 34% of \\ntotal accounts receivable as at 31 December 2022 \\n(31 December 2021: 25%), noting that at the same time, \\nthese customers have payable balances from the Group \\ncovering approximately 83% of their accounts receivable \\nbalances (31 December 2021: 90%). The rest of the \\nbalances do not have significant concentration of credit \\nrisk, with exposure spread over large number of customers. \\n29.3.2  LIQUIDITY RISK\\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter \\ndifficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial \\nliabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another \\nfinancial asset. The Group’s approach in managing liquidity \\nis to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have \\nsufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due without \\nincurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the \\nGroup’s reputation.\\nThe management closely and continuously monitors the \\nliquidity risk by performing regular review of available Less than one \\nyear1 to 5\\nyearsMore than 5 \\nyearsTotal contractual \\ncash flowsCarrying \\namount\\nAt 31 December 2022\\nBorrowings 1,937 ,177 8,410,079 1,110,105 11,457 ,361 9,623,840\\nLease liabilities 1,124,980 1,558,163 896,222 3,579,365 3,221,034\\nAccounts payable 4,531,738 - - 4,531,738 4,531,738\\nDue to related parties 161,127 - - 161,127 161,127\\nFinancial liabilities 63,739 155,354 75,983 295,076 259,485\\n7,818,761 10,123,596 2,082,310 20,024,667 17,797,224\\nAt 31 December 2021\\nBorrowings 1,553,664 9,289,846 1,592,480 12,435,990 10,834,358\\nLease liabilities 1,044,352 1,620,227 814,402 3,478,981 3,120,391\\nAccounts payable 4,606,445 - - 4,606,445 4,606,445\\nDue to related parties 281,563 - - 281,563 281,563\\nFinancial liabilities - 155,354 114,822 270,176 223,653\\nDerivatives financial instruments 45,841 - - 45,841 45,841\\n7,531,865 11,065,427 2,521,704 21,118,996 19,112,251\\n190 191\\nMOBILY ANNUAL REPORT 2022 Overview   I  Strategic Review  I  Business Review  I  ESG  I  Financial Statements', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Mobily AR_2022_English (1).pdf', 'page': 95}), Document(page_content='Etihad Etisalat Company (A Saudi Joint Stock Company)\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  \\nFor the year ended 31 December 2022\\n(ALL AMOUNTS IN SAUDI RIYALS THOUSANDS UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED)32  COST OF REVENUE\\n33  SELLING AND MARKETING EXPENSES\\n34  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\\n35  FINANCE COSTS30  CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\\nThe Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as \\nto maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to \\nsustain future development of the business. \\nThe Group monitors its capital base using a ratio of Net \\ndebt to shareholders’ equity.
